    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.                 

    INF   The ratio of peak float (fp32) to double (fp64) performance on this device is 32:1. The kernel achieved 2% of 
          this device's fp32 peak performance and 0% of its fp64 peak performance. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 1.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.01 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.22 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.2% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.4% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 1.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          0.99 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.5% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 30.3% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.3% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.6% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.6% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.7% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 1.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.2% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.6% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.3% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.6% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.22 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.1% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.4% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.01 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.22 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.8% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.5% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          0.99 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.5% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving       
          frequently used data to registers and to shared memory.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.7% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 30.5% of the total average of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 30.3% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 4.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture, rtcore) operation. This represents about 31.1% of the total average   
          of 4.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data          
          accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase       
          cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving

          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.
