    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.

    WRN   FMA is the highest-utilized pipeline (98.0%). It executes 32-bit floating point (FADD, FMUL, FMAD, ...) and   
          integer (IMUL, IMAD) operations. The pipeline is over-utilized and likely a performance bottleneck. See the   
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-decoder) or

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.                                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.5% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.4% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.4% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.4% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.5% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.81 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.5% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.81 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.5% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.5% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.5% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.91 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.80 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled due to not being selected by the         
          scheduler. This represents about 31.6% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.   
          Not selected warps are eligible warps that were not picked by the scheduler to issue that cycle as another    
          warp was selected. A high number of not selected warps typically means you have sufficient warps to cover     
          warp latencies and you may consider reducing the number of active warps to possibly increase cache coherence  
          and data locality.                                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a math execution pipeline to 
          be available. This represents about 31.5% of the total average of 6.9 cycles between issuing two              
          instructions. This stall occurs when all active warps execute their next instruction on a specific,           
          oversubscribed math pipeline. Try to increase the number of active warps to hide the existent latency or try  
          changing the instruction mix to utilize all available pipelines in a more balanced way.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.31 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.2 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 36.3% of the total average of 3.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.
