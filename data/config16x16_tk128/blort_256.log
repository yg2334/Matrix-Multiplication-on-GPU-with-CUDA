    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.9% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.8% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 16 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 40             
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 33.0% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.9% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.9% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.7% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.8% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   LSU is the highest-utilized pipeline (89.6%). It executes load/store memory operations. The pipeline is       
          over-utilized and likely a performance bottleneck. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.96 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.9% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.8% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 33.0% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 32.9% of the total average of 4.5 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the
