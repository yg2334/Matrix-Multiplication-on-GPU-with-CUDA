    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 53.8% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.99 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 54.1% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 54.0% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 54.0% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 54.0% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 53.9% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of

          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 54.0% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 53.9% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to

          accesses an average of 3.4 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.1 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory         
          request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 53.9% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.5 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 54.0% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.42 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 54.0% of the total average of 6.4 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.
