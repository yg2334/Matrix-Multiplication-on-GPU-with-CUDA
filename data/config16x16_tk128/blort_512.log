    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.                 

    INF   The ratio of peak float (fp32) to double (fp64) performance on this device is 32:1. The kernel achieved 24%   
          of this device's fp32 peak performance and 0% of its fp64 peak performance. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

          LSU is the highest-utilized pipeline (67.5%). It executes load/store memory operations. The pipeline is       
          well-utilized and might become a bottleneck if more work is added. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to

          accesses an average of 3.4 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.0 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.01 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.46 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.0 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 49.3% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.0 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.01 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.45 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.0 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 49.2% of the total average of 6.1 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

          hardware busy.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.95 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.45 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.0 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 50.3% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.0 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.45 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.1 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 52.3% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.0 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          2.03 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.45 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.0 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 48.8% of the total average of 6.2 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.94 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.44 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.1 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 50.7% of the total average of 6.1 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.95 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.45 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.1 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 51.2% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 3.4 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.94 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.44 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.1 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 50.7% of the total average of 6.1 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate

          LSU is the highest-utilized pipeline (68.2%). It executes load/store memory operations. The pipeline is       
          well-utilized and might become a bottleneck if more work is added. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.92 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.44 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.1 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 50.8% of the total average of 6.1 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.                 

    INF   The ratio of peak float (fp32) to double (fp64) performance on this device is 32:1. The kernel achieved 24%   
          of this device's fp32 peak performance and 0% of its fp64 peak performance. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.95 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.45 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.0 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 48.8% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.                 

    INF   The ratio of peak float (fp32) to double (fp64) performance on this device is 32:1. The kernel achieved 24%   
          of this device's fp32 peak performance and 0% of its fp64 peak performance. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

          LSU is the highest-utilized pipeline (68.2%). It executes load/store memory operations. The pipeline is       
          well-utilized and might become a bottleneck if more work is added. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 3.4 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.96 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.45 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 2.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 3.1 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 51.3% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.
