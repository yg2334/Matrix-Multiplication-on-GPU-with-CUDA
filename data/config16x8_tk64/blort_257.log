    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.                                                             
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 5.2 sectors per request, or 5.2*32 = 165.4 bytes of cache data transfers per request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          0.99 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 5.2 sectors per request, or 5.2*32 = 165.4 bytes of cache data transfers per request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          0.99 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          0.99 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.      
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 1.1 cycles being stalled on a fixed latency execution dependency. 
          This represents about 38.9% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically,   
          this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized       
          kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the number of active warps,        
          restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to lower-latency instructions,     
          e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 21.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().
