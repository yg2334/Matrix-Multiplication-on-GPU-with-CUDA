    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 4.0 sectors per request, or 4.0*32 = 129.4 bytes of cache data transfers per request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.3 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.3% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.                                   
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 9 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 40              
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.3 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.4% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.                                   
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.6% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.                                   
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 4.0 sectors per request, or 4.0*32 = 129.5 bytes of cache data transfers per request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.5% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.                                   
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.99 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.3 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.1% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

          section for uncoalesced stores and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory        
          request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.05 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.5% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.                                   
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 4.0 sectors per request, or 4.0*32 = 129.4 bytes of cache data transfers per request.

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.3 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.1% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.                                   
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.05 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.3 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.4% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.                                   
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.05 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.5% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.

    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of    
          3.98 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 8. Use the Occupancy section to identify what limits this kernel's theoretical occupancy.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------
    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 2.3 cycles being stalled waiting for an MIO instruction queue to  
          be not full. This represents about 30.3% of the total average of 7.7 cycles between issuing two               
          instructions. This stall reason is high in cases of utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special   
          math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory      
          accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.

    INF   Check the Source Counters section for the top stall locations in your source based on sampling data. The      
          Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#sampling) provides   
          more details on each stall reason.                                                                            
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WRN   Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 22.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition,    
          ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a      
          data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp().
